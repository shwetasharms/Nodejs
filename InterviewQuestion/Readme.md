# 1️⃣ Node.js Fundamentals

### What is Node.js, and how does it work?

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 engine. It allows JavaScript to be executed server-side, enabling full-stack development with one language. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, making it efficient for handling real-time applications and heavy I/O operations.

### Explain the event-driven, non-blocking I/O model in Node.js.

In Node.js, an event-driven architecture means actions (like HTTP requests) trigger events, and the event loop handles them asynchronously. The non-blocking I/O model ensures that operations, such as reading from a file, don't block the execution of the rest of the code. Instead, callbacks are used to handle the result once the operation completes.

### How does Node.js differ from traditional web servers like Apache or Nginx?

Traditional web servers like Apache and Nginx are multi-threaded, meaning each request spawns a new thread. In contrast, Node.js is single-threaded and handles multiple requests via its event loop. This architecture allows Node.js to handle high volumes of concurrent connections with lower resource overhead.

### How does the V8 engine work in Node.js?

The V8 engine is Google's open-source JavaScript engine that powers Node.js. It compiles JavaScript code directly into machine code, enabling faster execution. Node.js uses the V8 engine to execute JavaScript code on the server side.

### What is the role of the package.json file in a Node.js project?

The `package.json` file is the manifest of a Node.js project. It includes important metadata like the project name, version, dependencies, and scripts. This file is essential for managing project dependencies via npm or yarn.

### Explain the purpose and use of npm (Node Package Manager).

npm is the default package manager for Node.js, allowing developers to install, update, and manage project dependencies. It also serves as a platform for publishing and sharing reusable code packages.

# 2️⃣ Asynchronous Programming

### How do you handle asynchronous code in Node.js?

Asynchronous code in Node.js is primarily handled using callbacks, Promises, and `async/await`. These methods ensure that long-running operations (e.g., reading files or making HTTP requests) don’t block the execution of other code.

[Read more about asynchronous programming](https://nodejs.org/en/docs)

---

### What are callbacks, and how do they work in Node.js?

Callbacks are functions passed as arguments to other functions. In Node.js, callbacks are used to handle asynchronous operations. Once the async operation is completed, the callback is invoked with the result or an error.

---

### Explain Promises and how they improve asynchronous code handling.

Promises provide a cleaner way to handle asynchronous operations. They represent a value that will be resolved or rejected in the future, helping avoid "callback hell" by chaining `.then()` and `.catch()` methods for success and error handling.

---

### How does async/await work in Node.js?

`async/await` is syntactic sugar built on Promises, allowing for cleaner, more readable asynchronous code. By using `await`, you can "pause" the execution of the function until the Promise is resolved, making the code appear synchronous while remaining non-blocking.

---

### What is "callback hell," and how can you avoid it?

"Callback hell" occurs when multiple nested callbacks make the code hard to read and maintain. It can be avoided by using Promises or `async/await` to write more structured and readable asynchronous code.

# 3️⃣ Event Loop

### Describe the Node.js event loop.

The event loop is a core mechanism in Node.js that handles asynchronous tasks. It allows Node.js to perform non-blocking I/O operations by offloading tasks like I/O operations, timers, and HTTP requests to the system, which reports back once they're complete.

[Read more about the Event Loop](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/event-loop-timers-and-nexttick/)

[Back to top](#table-of-contents)

---

### How does the event loop manage asynchronous operations in Node.js?

The event loop manages asynchronous operations by executing callbacks in phases. Tasks like I/O operations are handed off to the OS, and when complete, the associated callbacks are placed in the callback queue for execution in the next phase of the event loop.

[Read more about asynchronous operations](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/event-loop-timers-and-nexttick/)

[Back to top](#table-of-contents)

---

### What are the phases of the event loop?

The event loop has several phases, including timers, I/O callbacks, idle, polling, and check. Each phase processes specific types of callbacks, ensuring non-blocking execution of tasks.

### How does the event loop affect performance in a Node.js application?

Efficient use of the event loop can significantly improve the performance of a Node.js application. Poor handling of asynchronous tasks, like blocking the event loop with heavy computation, can degrade performance, leading to slower response times.

# 4️⃣ Modules and Packages

### What are Node.js modules, and how do you create them?

Modules in Node.js are reusable blocks of code that can be imported and exported. You create modules using the `module.exports` object to export functionality and `require()` to import them into other files.

[Read more about modules](https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html)

[Back to top](#table-of-contents)

---

### Explain the difference between CommonJS and ES6 modules.

CommonJS modules use `require()` and `module.exports`, while ES6 modules use `import` and `export`. ES6 modules offer better static analysis and support for tree-shaking, making them more efficient in modern applications.

---

### How does the module caching mechanism work in Node.js?

When a module is first required, Node.js caches the module. Subsequent calls to `require()` will return the cached instance rather than re-executing the module code. This improves performance by avoiding redundant execution.

[Read more about module caching](https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_caching)

### What are some commonly used Node.js built-in modules?

Commonly used built-in modules include:
- `http`: To create servers.
- `fs`: To handle file operations.
- `path`: To handle file paths.
- `events`: To manage event-driven programming.

# 5️⃣ File System and Streams

### How do you handle file operations (read, write, delete) in Node.js?

Node.js provides the `fs` module to handle file operations like reading (`fs.readFile()`), writing (`fs.writeFile()`), and deleting (`fs.unlink()`). These operations can be done both synchronously and asynchronously.
